      name: 'Plant Leaf Disease Detection',
      description: 'Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect diseases in potato plant leaves with a high accuracy of 97.27%. The project involved creating an image-based classification system to identify common diseases such as early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves.Preprocessed a large dataset of annotated leaf images using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model generalization. Designed and trained the CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras, optimizing hyperparameters to improve performance. Validated the model using test data, achieving robust accuracy and precision.',
